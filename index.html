	<b>The Weiz Guys & Gals have gone Virtual</b>
	</h2>
	<p>Because of COVID 19 outbreak, it is no longer possible to have our traditional “in person” club meetings. To keep our Club strong and active, our meetings are now online. During our meetings, we are having informative presentations, virtual tours, and sharing homebrew knowledge. Sign up for the Club Google Group to receive the email that includes the meeting link. The Weiz Guys & Gals continue to create a stronger community through the power of beer.</p>
